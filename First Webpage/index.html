<h1>Len Pelletier</h1>

<p>Hello! I am Mr. Pelletier. I have been a teacher at Lord Byng Secondary for 14 years, teaching Math and Computer Science! I am from Terrace, B.C. and moved to Vancouver in 1997 to attend UBC for Computer Science. After graduation, I went into the software industry but there was a big disaster called the "Dot Com Crash" and many people lost their jobs! I was fortunate enough to have a software job but it wasn't very fun. So, I started volunteering at high schools to teach programming and math and had so much fun! So, here I am now!</p>
